For my github repository I chose the MIT license. I want my github repository to be open to other users to add and contribute to my own works. I don't plan on making substantial and financial gain on the work in this repository but instead on making work that will benefit users collectively. I also don't want to be liable if someone uses the work I made and creates damaging or nefarious software. Overall I think this license best fits the type of work I want to create, and will best help other users improve and contribute to my work.
